`nexers` parses Nexus repository indexes, including the one provided by
[maven central](https://search.maven.org/). It can optionally build a relational
database based on this data.


## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

`1.34.2` (Debian Stable 2019) is pinned in Travis. Much older currently works fine,
but I don't plan to do extra work to make it happen. MSRV bumps are some kind of
semver bump, to be decided for `1.0.0`.
